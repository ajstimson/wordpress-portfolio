# Examples of My Past Work

This repository contains examples of code I have written in the past. To view visual examples of how this code was used, visit my [portfolio site](https://applejuice.codes).
<br>Below is a brief summary of each project:

## Plugin Demo

This plugin was written in 2016 with a collaborator to help users find locations to recycle excess paint using the Google Maps JavaScript API. We used the Redux framework to build the WP-Admin UI, and the plugin is still in use at [PaintCare Locator](https://www.paintcare.org/drop-off-sites/).

## WordPress Template Demo

I customized the Genesis Corporate Pro theme using a custom PHP template and Advanced Custom Fields for IDExperts. The template accommodates 4 design types, depending on the type of breach and service purchased by IDExpert's client.

## Web Application

In 2019, I built a product configuration web application using the WordPress Gravity Forms plugin, Bootstrap, Pagination.js, Cart.js, and my own custom JavaScript code. The application offers the following features:

-   Dynamic product configuration (e.g. product options are displayed based on the user's selections)
-   Dynamic quotes (e.g. product pricing is displayed based on the user's selections)
-   Cart system for combining multiple product configurations
-   Customer dashboard for managing orders
-   Admin dashboard for managing users and orders

Initially, the client required support for legacy browsers (IE9), so the JavaScript files could not use ES5 syntax. You can visit the site at [Woodfold Elevator Gate Order Form](https://woodfold.com/elevator/order-form/?user=guest).

## Headless WordPress

In 2021, I built a front-end application using React, Next.js, and TypeScript to serve up WordPress REST API data. This was accomplished by utilizing a headless WordPress architecture. You can visit the site at [EVA](https://evergreenvirtual.org).
