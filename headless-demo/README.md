# ORVA - Public Frontend Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-typescript-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-next-typescript-app).

## Purpose

This is a code example for demo purposes only. This repository will not run as an application. All private data, API references and security information have been removed or replaced.

## Stack Characteristics

This project uses the Next.js React Framework and TypeScript to interface with a headless WordPress CMS. The application produces a static HTML website that can communicate with the remote WordPress REST API, allowing clients to edit content in a familiar WYSIWYG environment. 
The application includes a docker.compose file used for running multi-container Docker applications.
