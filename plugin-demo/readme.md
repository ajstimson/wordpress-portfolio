# PaintCare Locator Plugin

Written in 2016 with a collaborator Anthony Brown, this plugin is still in use at [PaintCare: Find a Drop-Off Site](https://www.paintcare.org/drop-off-sites/).

The project uses the following dependencies:

-   Google Maps JavaScript API
-   Redux framework to build the WP-Admin UI
